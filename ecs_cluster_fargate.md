# Module 1: Creating a New ECS Cluster

1. **Fargate**: Use Fargate to run containers without managing servers.
2. **CloudWatch Insight Monitoring**: Enable CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
3. **KMS Keys**: Optionally, use KMS keys for encryption.
4. **Cost**: No cost to run the ECS cluster itself.

## Creating a Standalone Task
- **ECS Task IAM Role**: Assign an IAM role to the ECS task.
- **ECS Security Group**: Configure the security group for the task.
- **VPC**:
  - **Public Subnets**: Ensure the public subnet is attached to an internet gateway to pull the ECR image. If not, you may encounter errors like `CannotPullContainerError`.
  - **Public IP**: Enable assigning a public IP. If using a private IP, a NAT gateway is needed to access the image from ECR or Docker Hub.
- **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: A fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.
- **Task Definition**: Go to the task definition section.
- **Create Task Definition**: Create a new task definition for the `hello-svc`.
- **CloudWatch**: Use CloudWatch for monitoring.

This is the simplest way to run any Docker image on ECS as a standalone task. If the container crashes, the application will be down. This feature is useful for running scheduled jobs as standalone tasks at defined intervals.

# Module 2: ECS Services

- **Replica**: ECS ensures your task is always running with the desired number of tasks.
  - **Rolling Update**: ECS starts a new task before stopping the existing one.
  - **Min Running Tasks**: Minimum number of tasks running during updates.
  - **Max Running Tasks**: Maximum number of tasks running during updates.

# Module 3: ALB & Listener Rules

- **Private Subnet**: Run your application inside a private subnet for security.
  - **Load Balancer**: Explore load balancer options.
  - **Port Mapping**: Ensure the task definition has at least one exposed port for the load balancer to route traffic.
  - **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: Create an ALB.
  - **Target Group**: Create a target group.
  - **Listener Rules**: Use listener rules for path-based forwarding.
  - **hello and world service path based filter**
  - **internet facing**

# Module 4: Service Discovery and DNS

In this example, we will explore how to deploy Java microservices using ECS Service Discovery.

## Requirements

### CloudMap
- **CloudMap**: Create a CloudMap for service discovery.
  - **What is CloudMap?**
    - AWS Cloud Map is a cloud resource discovery service. It allows you to define custom names for your application resources, and it maintains the updated location of these dynamically changing resources. This helps in service discovery and makes it easier to manage microservices.

### Service Discovery
- **Service Discovery**: Deploy multiple microservices and connect them using service discovery and DNS names.
  - Use AWS Cloud Map to register your services.
  - Configure ECS to use service discovery for your microservices.
  - Ensure that each service can be discovered using a DNS name.

### Architecture
- **Architecture**: Use internal DNS names to maintain consistent URLs across environments, reducing complexity.
  - Define internal DNS names for each service.
  - Use these DNS names in your application code to ensure consistency across different environments (development, staging, production).

## Microservices

### Hello Service
- **Hello Service**: Returns the message "hello from service".
  - Implement a simple Java service that responds with "hello from service".
  - Register this service with CloudMap.

### World Service
- **World Service**: Returns the message "world from service".
  - Implement a simple Java service that responds with "world from service".
  - Register this service with CloudMap.

### Client Service
- **Client Service**: Acts as a front-end service that communicates with both Hello and World services and presents the data to the end users.
  - Implement a Java service that:
    - Calls the Hello Service and retrieves the message.
    - Calls the World Service and retrieves the message.
    - Combines the messages and presents them to the end user.
  - Register this service with CloudMap.
  - Ensure that it uses the internal DNS names to communicate with Hello and World services.

### Service Specific Resources

These resources are unique across all microservices:

Now that we have three microservices, we'll use a monorepo setup for deployment. Here's what each service needs to deploy on the ECS cluster:

- **ECS Task Definition**: Defines the container specifications and resources for your microservice.
- **ECS Service**: Manages the deployment and scaling of your ECS tasks.
- **Target Groups**: Directs traffic to the appropriate ECS tasks based on routing rules.
- **ECS IAM Role**: Grants necessary permissions for ECS tasks to interact with other AWS services.
- **ECS Security Groups**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to ensure secure communication.
- **ALB Listener Rules**: Routes incoming traffic to the correct target groups based on specified conditions.

To reduce duplication and simplify maintenance, we'll use reusable Terraform modules. This approach allows us to use the same code across all microservices, making future updates easier. Here's how we'll structure it:

- **Modules Folder**: This folder will contain all the code needed to deploy your service on the ECS cluster and use the datasource to fetch the shared AWS resources. The module code is designed to use variables, allowing us to pass different values when calling the module. This approach ensures flexibility and reusability, enabling the same module to be used across multiple services with varying configurations.
- **Microservices Folders**: We'll create a folder for each microservice. Inside each folder, we'll have a Terraform folder that calls the module, passing all the necessary values for the service to be deployed on the ECS cluster successfully.

### GitHub Actions for Deployment

Next, let's set up GitHub Actions for deployment. We'll start with Continuous Integration (CI) for our Java project built using Maven:

1. **Build the Maven Project**: Use GitHub Actions to build the Maven project and specify the Java version.
2. **Upload the Artifact**: Upload the artifact and set a retention period to avoid keeping it indefinitely. This artifact is used temporarily to build the Docker image, which will be published in ECR.
3. **Download the Artifact**: Download the artifact for use in the Docker build process.
4. **Docker Build**: Build the Docker image.
5. **Push to ECR**: Push the Docker image to public ECR using a version tag based on `github.sha`. This practice ensures that we always deploy using a specific version rather than the latest tag.

For deployment, we'll use Terraform commands:

- **Terraform Init**: Initialize Terraform.
- **Terraform Plan**: Plan the deployment.
- **Terraform Apply**: Apply the deployment, passing the container version using `TF_VAR` as an environment variable from GitHub Actions.

By following these steps, we ensure that all shared infrastructure is successfully deployed in your AWS account, and each microservice is efficiently managed and deployed using reusable Terraform modules and GitHub Actions.

### Advantages of This Approach

- **Automation**: Everything is automated, ensuring a smooth and efficient deployment process.
- **Effective Management**: This design allows you to manage your shared infrastructure properly and separately from your microservices.
- **Quick Deployment**: With this setup, everything can be deployed successfully in just 2â€“3 minutes. Any new microservice can be integrated into this process with minimal effort and time.
- **Rapid Environment Setup**: Any new environment deployment can be set up in 2â€“3 minutes, making it easy to scale and adapt to new requirements.
